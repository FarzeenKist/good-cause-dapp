GoodCause is a decentralized crowdfunding site that lets people from all around the world help others kickstart their projects or help each other achieve their goal.
It's very simple: 
-üí≤ Get a CELO wallet and give it some funds. You will need CELO to pay transaction fees, and cUSD, the coin with which donations are paid.
-üåê Then connect it with the DApp
-‚úîÔ∏è You're done! 
-‚ù§Ô∏è You can now upload a request or help other people by donating to them.

You can test this DApp right now! Go to:

or
Click the "github-pages" environment and click "view deployment"!

How to use?
If you want to ask for money:
-Connect your wallet.
-Click "New Request" near the upper left corner
-Add a title, a description, and an image url to make your request more appealing
-Input your goal, in cUSD (1 cUSD = 1$)
-Hint: Descriptions must be short, so I recommend adding a link to anywhere else in order to explain yourself better, this will be more trustable than simply adding a few words

If you want to help people:
-Connect your wallet
-Browse the site and look for a request
-Once you find one, click the input box inside the card and write how much you want to donate
-Click "Donate NOW" and finish the transaction with your wallet
-Hint: Look for well documented requests in order to avoid illegitimate ones, always read descriptions and the links inside!
